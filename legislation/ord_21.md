\(1\) After a writ has been issued in an action in rem a warrant in Form
106 for the arrest of the property against which the action or any
counterclaim in the action is brought may, subject to this Rule, be
issued at the instance of the plaintiff or of the defendant, as the case
may be.

\(2\) A party applying for the issue out of the registry of a warrant to
arrest any property shall procure a search to be made in the caveat book

for it has filed a praecipe in Form 107 requesting issue of the warrant
together with an affidavit made by him or his agent containing the
particulars required by Sub-rules (6), (7), (8) and (10) so that the
Court may, if it thinks fit, allow the warrant to issue notwithstanding
that the affidavit does not contain all those particulars.

\(4\) Except with the leave of the Court or where notice has been given
under Sub-rule (10) a warrant of arrest shall not be issued in an action
in rem against a foreign ship belonging to a port of a State having a
consulate in Port Moresby, being an action for possession of the ship or
for wages, until notice that the action has been begun has been sent to
the consul.

\(5\) Except with the leave of the Court, a warrant of arrest shall not
be issued in an action in rem in which there is a claim arising out of
bottomry until the bottomry bond and, if the bond is in a foreign
language, a notarial translation of it is produced to the Registrar or
district registrar, as the case may be.

\(6\) Every affidavit must state ---

warrant; and

\(b\) the nature of the claim or counterclaim in respect of which the
warrant is required and that it has not been satisfied; and

is a ship, the name of the ship and the port to which she belongs.

\(7\) Every affidavit in an action in rem brought against a ship by
virtue of Section of the must state ---

\(a\) whether the ship against which the action is brought is the ship
in connection with which the claim in the action arose; and

\(b\) that in the belief of the deponent the person who would, apart
from Section of that Act, be liable on the claim in an action in
personam was, when the cause of action arose, the owner or charterer,
or in possession or control, of the ship in connection with which the
claim arose and was also, at the time of the issue of the writ, the
beneficial owner of all the shares in the ship against which the
action is brought; and

\(c\) the grounds of the deponent\'s belief.

\(8\) Every affidavit in an action in rem for possession of a ship or
for wages must state the nationality of the ship against which the
action is brought and that the notice (if any) required by Sub-rule (4)
has been sent and a copy of such notice must be exhibited to the
affidavit.

\(9\) An affidavit in an action referred to in Sub-rule (5) must have
annexed to it a certified copy of the bottomry bond, or of the
translation of the bond.

\(10\) Where, by any convention or treaty, Papua New Guinea has
undertaken to minimise the possibility of arrest of ships of another
State, an application shall not be made for the issue of a warrant of
arrest in an action in rem against a ship owned by that State until
notice in Form 118 has been served on a consular officer at the consular
office of that State in Port Moresby or the port at which it is intended
to cause the ship to be arrested.

\(11\) In a case to which Sub-rule (10) applies the affidavit required
by Sub-rule (3) shall state that the notice required by Sub-rule (10)
has been served and a copy of the notice shall be exhibited to the
affidavit.

### 6\. Caveat against arrest. (UK 75/6)

\(1\) A person who desires to prevent the arrest of any property must
file in the registry a praecipe, in Form 108 signed by him or his
solicitor undertaking ---

be begun against the property described in the praecipe; and

\(b\) within three days after receiving notice that such an action has
been begun, to give bail in the action in a sum not exceeding an
amount specified in the praecipe or to pay the amount so specified
into Court,

and on the filing of the praecipe a caveat against the issue of a
warrant to arrest the property described in the praecipe shall be
entered in the caveat book.

\(2\) The fact that there is a caveat against arrest in force shall not
prevent the issue of a warrant to arrest the property to which the
caveat relates.

### 7\. Remedy where property protected by caveat is arrested without good
and sufficient reason. (UK 75/7)

Where any property with respect to which a caveat against arrest is in
force is arrested in pursuance of a warrant of arrest, the party at
whose instance the caveat was entered may apply to the Court by motion
for an order under this Rule and, on the hearing of the application, the
Court, unless it is satisfied that the party procuring the arrest of the
property had a good and sufficient reason for doing so, may by order
discharge the warrant and may also order the last mentioned party to pay
to the applicant damages in respect of the loss suffered by the
applicant as a result of the arrest.

### 8\. Service of writ in action in rem. (UK 75/8)

into Court---it must be served on the Registrar or, if the writ was
issued out of a district registry, on the registrar of that registry.

\(2\) A writ need not be served on the property or registrar mentioned
in Sub-rule (1) if the writ is deemed to have been duly served on the
defendant by virtue of Order 6 Rule 2 or 8.

\(3\) Where by virtue of this Rule a writ is required to be served on
any property, the plaintiff may request service of the writ to be
effected by the marshal if a warrant of arrest has been issued for
service against the property or the property is under arrest, and in
that case the Plaintiff must file in the registry a praecipe in Form 109
and lodge ---

\(a\) the writ and a copy of it; and

\(b\) an undertaking to pay on demand all expenses incurred by the
marshal or his substitute in respect of the service of the writ,

and the marshal or his substitute shall serve the writ on the property
described in the praecipe.

\(4\) Where the plaintiff in an action in rem, or his solicitor, becomes
aware that there is in force a caveat against arrest with respect to the
property against which the action is brought, he must serve the writ
immediately on the person at whose instance the caveat was entered.

\(5\) Where a writ by which an action in rem is begun is amended under
Order 8 Rule 51, after service of the writ, Order 8 Rule 58, shall not
apply and, unless the Court otherwise directs on an application made ex
parte, the amended writ must be served on any defendant who has entered

notice, on the property or registrar referred to in Sub-rule (1).

### 9\. Committal of solicitor failing to comply with undertaking. (UK 75/9)

Where the solicitor of a party to an action in rem fails to comply with
a written undertaking given by him to any other party or his solicitor

of its issue.

and custody of it while under arrest has been lodged in the marshal\'s
office.

\(4\) A warrant of arrest shall not be executed if the party at whose
instance it was issued lodges a written request to that effect with the
marshal.

(in the case of the warrant) in its place or (in the case of the writ)
on a sheltered, conspicuous part of the ship.

\(2\) Service of a warrant of arrest or writ in an action in rem against
freight or cargo or both shall, if the cargo has been landed or

is sold under an order of the Court, property which has been so arrested
shall only be released under the authority of an instrument of release
(in this Rule referred to as a \"release\"), in Form 110 or 117 issued
out of the registry.

\(2\) A party at whose instance any property was arrested may, before a
notice of intention to defend is entered in the action, file a notice
withdrawing the warrant of arrest and, if he does so, a release shall,

property.

\(3\) Unless the Court otherwise orders, a release shall not be issued
with respect to property as to which a caveat against release is in
force.

\(4\) A release may be issued at the instance of a party interested in
the property under arrest if the Court so orders, or, subject to
Sub-rule (3), if all the other parties to the action in which the
warrant of arrest was issued, consent.

\(5\) Before a release is issued the party entitled to its issue must
---

\(a\) if there is a caveat against release in force as to the property
in question-give notice to the party at whose instance it was entered
or his solicitor requiring the caveat to be withdrawn; and

\(b\) file a praecipe in Form 111 requesting issue of a release.

\(6\) Before property under arrest is released in compliance with a
release issued under this Rule, the party at whose instance it was

all such fees and expenses, whether incurred or to be incurred.

\(7\) The Court, on the application of any party who objects to
directions given to him by the marshal under Sub-rule (6), may vary or
revoke the directions.

### 14\. Caveat against release and payment. (UK 75/14)

\(1\) A person who desires to prevent the release of any property under
arrest in an action in rem and the payment out of Court of any money in
Court representing the proceeds of sale of that property, must file in
the registry a praecipe in Form 112 and on the filing of the praecipe a
caveat against the issue of a release with respect to that property and
the payment out of Court of that money shall be entered in the caveat
book.

\(2\) Where the release of any property under arrest is delayed by the
entry of a caveat under this Rule, any person having an interest in that
property may apply to the Court by motion for an order requiring the
person who procured the entry of the caveat to pay to the applicant
damages in respect of the loss suffered by the applicant by reason of
the delay, and the Court, unless it is satisfied that the person
procuring the entry of the caveat had a good and sufficient reason for
doing so, may make an order accordingly.

### 15\. Duration of caveats. (UK 75/15)

beginning with the date of its entry but the person at whose instance a
caveat was entered may withdraw it by filing a praecipe in Form 113.

provision shall not be taken as preventing the entry of successive
caveats.

bond in Form 114, and the sureties to the bond must enter into the bond

partner, is acting as solicitor or agent for the party on whose behalf
the bail is to be given, or before the Registrar.

\(2\) Subject to Sub-rule (3), a surety to a bail bond must make an
affidavit stating that he is able to pay the sum for which the bond is
given.

\(3\) Where a corporation is a surety to a bail bond given on behalf of
a party, an affidavit shall not be made under Sub-rule (2) on behalf of
the corporation unless the opposite party requires it, but where such an
affidavit is required it must be made by a director, manager, secretary
or other similar officer of the corporation.

\(4\) The party on whose behalf bail is given must serve on the opposite
party a notice of bail containing the names and addresses of the persons
who have given bail on his behalf and of the Commissioner or Registrar
before whom the bail bond was entered into, and after the expiration of
24 hours from the service of the notice (or sooner with the consent of
the opposite party) he may file the bond and must at the same time file
the affidavits (if any) made under Sub-rule (2) and an affidavit proving
due service of the notice of bail to which a copy of that notice must be
exhibited.

### 17\. Interveners. (UK 75/17)

\(1\) Where property against which an action in rem is brought is under
arrest or money representing the proceeds of sale of that property is in
Court, a person who has an interest in that property or money but who is
not a defendant to the action may, with the leave of the Court,
intervene in the action.

\(2\) An application for the grant of leave under this Rule must be made
ex parte by affidavit showing the interest of the applicant in the
property against which the action is brought or in the money in Court.

\(3\) A person to whom leave is granted to intervene in an action must
enter a Notice of Intention to Defend in the registry within the period
specified in the order granting leave, and Order 7 shall, with the
necessary modifications, apply in relation to the entry of notice by an
intervener as if he were a defendant named in the writ.

\(4\) The Court may order that a person to whom it grants leave to
intervene in an action shall, within such period as may be specified in
the order, serve on every other party to the action such pleading as may
be so specified.

### 18\. Preliminary acts. (UK 75/18)

\(1\) In an action to enforce a claim for damage, loss of life or
personal injury arising out of a collision between ships, unless the
Court otherwise orders, the plaintiff must, within two months after
issue of the writ and the defendant must, within two months after
entering a notice of intention to defend in the action, and before any
pleading is served, lodge in the registry a document (in these Rules
referred to as a \"preliminary act\") containing a statement of ---

\(a\) the names of the ships which came into collision and their ports
of registry; and

\(b\) the date and time of the collision; and

\(c\) the place of the collision; and

\(d\) the direction and force of the wind; and

\(e\) the state of the weather; and

\(f\) the state, direction and force of the tidal or other current;
and

\(g\) the course steered and speed through the water of the ship when
the other ship was first seen or immediately before any measures were
taken with reference to her presence, whichever was the earlier; and

\(h\) the lights (if any) carried by the ship; and

\(i\) the distance and bearing of the other ship if and when her echo
was first observed by radar; and

\(ii\) the distance, bearing and approximate heading of the other ship
when first seen; and

\(j\) what light or combination of lights (if any) of the other ship
was first seen; and

\(k\) what other lights or combinations of lights (if any) of the
other ship were subsequently seen before the collision, and when; and

\(l\) what alterations (if any) were made to the course and speed of
the ship after the earlier of the two times referred to in Paragraph
(g) up to the time of the collision, and when, and what measurers (if
any), other than alterations of course or speed, were taken to avoid
the collision, and when; and

\(m\) the parts of each ship which first came into contact and the
approximate angle between the two ships at the moment of contact; and

\(n\) what sound signals (if any) were given, and when; and

\(o\) what sound signals (if any) were heard from the other ship, and
when.

\(2\) Every preliminary act shall be sealed by the proper officer and
shall be filed in a closed envelope (stamped with an official stamp
showing the date of filing) and, unless the Court otherwise orders, no
envelope shall be opened until the pleadings are closed and a consent
signed by each of the parties or his solicitor to the opening of the
preliminary acts is filed with the proper officer.

\(3\) Where the Court orders the preliminary acts to be opened, the
Court may further order the action to be tried without pleadings but,
where the Court orders the action to be so tried, any party who intends
to rely on the defence of compulsory pilotage must give notice of his
intention to do so to the other parties within seven days after the
opening of the preliminary acts.

\(4\) Where the Court orders the action to be tried without pleadings,
it may also order each party, within such period as may be specified in
the order, to file a statement of the grounds on which he charges any
other party with negligence in connection with the collision and to
serve a copy on that other party.

\(5\) Order 8 Rule 3 shall not apply to an action in which preliminary
acts are required but, unless the Court orders the action to be tried
without pleadings, the plaintiff must serve a statement of claim on each
defendant within 14 days after the latest date on which the preliminary
act of any party to the action is filed.

### 19\. Failure to lodge preliminary act: Proceedings against party in
default. (UK 75/19)

\(1\) Where in an action referred to in Rule 18(1) the plaintiff fails
to lodge a preliminary act within the prescribed period, any defendant
who has lodged such an act may apply to the Court by motion for an order
to dismiss the action, and the Court may by order dismiss the action or
make such other order on such terms as it thinks just.

\(2\) Where in an action referred to in Sub-rule (1), being an action in
personam, a defendant fails to lodge a preliminary act within the
prescribed period, Order 12 Rule 26 shall apply as if the defendant\'s
failure to lodge the preliminary act within that period were a failure
by him to serve a notice of intention to defend on the plaintiff within
the period fixed by or under these Rules for service and the plaintiff,
if he has lodged a preliminary act may accordingly enter judgement
against that defendant in accordance with Order 12 Rule 26.

\(3\) Where in such an action, being an action in rem, a defendant fails
to lodge a preliminary act within the prescribed period, the plaintiff,
if he has lodged such an act, may apply to the Court by motion for
judgement against that defendant, and it shall not be necessary for the
plaintiff to file or serve a statement of claim or an affidavit before
the hearing of the motion.

\(4\) On the hearing of a motion under Sub-rule (3) the Court may make
such order as it thinks just, and where the defendant does not appear on
the hearing and the Court is of opinion that judgement should be given
for the plaintiff provided he proves his case, it shall order the
plaintiffs preliminary act to be opened and require the plaintiff to
satisfy the Court that his claim is well founded and the plaintiffs
evidence may, unless the Court otherwise orders, be given by affidavit
without any order or direction.

\(5\) Where the plaintiff in accordance with a requirement under
Sub-rule (4) satisfies the Court that his claim is well founded, the
Court may give judgement for the claim with or without a reference to
the Registrar and may at the same time order the property against which
the action is brought to be appraised and sold and the proceeds to be
paid into Court or make such order as it thinks just.

\(6\) The Court may, on such terms as it thinks just, set aside any
judgement entered under this Rule.

\(7\) In this Rule references to the prescribed period shall be
construed as references to the period within which by virtue of Rule
18(1) or of any order of the Court the plaintiff or defendant, as the
context of the reference requires, is required to lodge a preliminary
act.

### 20\. Special provisions as to pleadings in collision, etc., actions. (UK
75/20)

\(1\) Notwithstanding anything in Order 8 Rules 4 and 5, the plaintiff
in any action referred to in Rule 2(1)(a) may not serve a reply or a
defence to counterclaim on the defendant except with the leave of the
Court.

\(2\) If in such an action there is a counterclaim and no defence to
counterclaim by the plaintiff, then, notwithstanding Order 8 Rule 21,
there is an implied joinder of issue on the counterclaim, and the
joinder of issue operates as a denial of every material allegation of
fact made in the counterclaim.

### 21\. Judgement by default. (UK 75/21)

\(1\) Where a writ is served under Rule 8(4) on a party at whose
instance a caveat against arrest was issued, then if ---

\(a\) the sum claimed in the action begun by the writ does not exceed
the amount specified in the undertaking given by that party or his
solicitor to procure the entry of the caveat; and

\(b\) that party or his solicitor does not within 14 days after
service of the writ fulfil the undertaking given by him,

the plaintiff may, after filing an affidavit verifying the facts on
which the action is based, apply to the Court for judgement by default.

\(2\) Judgement given under Sub-rule (1) may be enforced by the arrest
of the property against which the action was brought and by committal of
the party at whose instance the caveat with respect to that property was
entered.

\(3\) Where a defendant to an action in rem fails to enter a Notice of
Intention to Defend within the time limited then, on the expiration of
14 days after service of the writ and on filing an affidavit proving due
service of the writ, an affidavit verifying the facts on which the
action is based and, if a statement of claim was not endorsed on the
writ, a copy of the statement of claim, the plaintiff may apply to the
Court for judgement by default.

(3A) Where the writ is deemed to have been duly served on the defendant
by virtue of Order 6 Rule 8 or was served on a registrar under Rule 8 of
this Order, an affidavit proving due service of the writ need not be
filed under this Sub-rule, but the writ endorsed under Order 6 Rule 8 or
endorsed by the Registrar with a statement that he accepts service of
the writ must be lodged with the affidavit verifying the facts on which
the action is based.

\(4\) Where a defendant to an action in rem fails to serve a defence on
the plaintiff, then, after the expiration of the period fixed by or
under these Rules for service of the defence and on filing an affidavit
stating that no defence was served on him by that defendant during that
period, an affidavit verifying the facts on which the action is based
and, if a statement of claim was not endorsed on the writ, a copy of the
statement of claim, the plaintiff may apply to the Court for judgement
by default.

\(5\) Where a defendant to a counterclaim in an action in rem fails to
serve a defence to counterclaim on the defendant making the
counterclaim, then, subject to Sub-rule (6), after the expiration of the
period fixed by or under these Rules for service of the defence to
counterclaim and on filing an affidavit stating that no defence to
counterclaim was served on him by the firstmentioned defendant during
that period, an affidavit verifying the facts on which the counterclaim
is based and a copy of the counterclaim, the defendant making the
counterclaim may apply to the Court for judgement by default.

\(6\) An application may not be made under Sub-rule (5) against the
plaintiff in any action referred to in Rule 2(1)(a).

\(7\) An application to the Court under this Rule must be made by motion
and if, on the hearing of the motion, the Court is satisfied that the
applicant\'s claim is well founded it may give judgement for the claim
with or without a reference to the Registrar and may at the same time
order the property against which the action or, as the case may be,
counterclaim is brought to be appraised and sold and the proceeds to be
paid into Court or may make such other order as it thinks just.

\(8\) In default actions in rem evidence may, unless the Court otherwise
orders, be given by affidavit without any order or direction.

\(9\) The Court may, on such terms as it thinks just, set aside or vary
any judgement entered under this Rule.

\(10\) Order 12 Division 3 shall not apply to actions in rem.

### 22\. Order for sale of ship: Determination of priority claims. (UK
75/22)

\(1\) Where in an action in rem against a ship the Court has ordered the
ship to be sold, any party who has obtained or obtains judgement against
the ship or proceeds of sale of the ship may ---

\(a\) in a case where the order for sale contains the further order
referred to in Sub-rule (2), after the expiration of the period
specified in the order under Sub-rule (2)(a); or

\(b\) in any other case, after obtaining judgement,

apply to the Court by motion for an order determining the order of
priority of the claims against the proceeds of sale of the ship.

\(2\) Where in an action in rem against a ship the Court orders the ship
to be sold, it may further order ---

\(a\) that the order of priority of the claims against the proceeds of
