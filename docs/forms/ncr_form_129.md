    NATIONAL COURT RULES

    A consolidation of the Rules of the National Court\
    made between 1983 and 2011 current at 1st December 2012

    Publication date 1st December 2012

[^2]: **RULES OF COURT**

    **NATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE**

    **Consolidation 1983-2011**

    Prior to the Independence of Papua New Guinea on 16 September 1975
    the superior trial court of Papua New Guinea was the Supreme Court,
    which sat with three or more judges as the appellate court. The
    Rules of the Supreme Court were substantially based on the Supreme
    Court Rules of Queensland, Australia.

    At Independence the Constitution established the National Court
    (Section 163(1)) as the superior trial court and the Supreme Court
    (Section 160(1)) as the appellate court. There are now different
    sets of rules with respect to the practice and procedure of each
    court. The National Court continued to function under the
    pre-Independence Rules of the Supreme Court until the National Court
    Rules were made by the Judges in 1983, pursuant to Section 184 of
    the Constitution. Many of the 1983 rules were sourced from the
    Supreme Court of New South Wales, some from the United Kingdom and
    others from the Australian Capital Territory and the Victorian Rules
    of Court. At the inception of the National Court Rules 1983 and for
    many years after reference works on the United Kingdom and New South
    Wales rules were found helpful. However now there are many Papua New
    Guinea cases to cite in aid of interpretation, especially in the
    more common areas of practice.

    This consolidation of the rules of court for the National Court has
    been occasioned by the fact that the original 1983 rules are out of
    print and, there has never been a consolidation of the 1983 rules,
    with amendments and new rules made since then. No amendments are
    introduced by this volume, which is strictly a consolidation of
    existing Rules. It brings together:

    ·National Court Rules 1983
    
    · National Court Appeal Rules 2005
    
    · National Court Motions Rules 2005
    
    · National Court Judicial Review Rules 2005
    
    · National Court Commercial List Rules 2005
    
    · National Court Election Petition Rules 2002 (as amended 2007)
    
    · ADR \[Alternative Dispute Resolution\] Rules 2010
    
    · Human Rights Rules 2010
    
    · Rules of the National Court of Justice (Underlying Law
    Amendment) 2011

    Most rules made since 1983 have been amendments to the National
    Court Rules 1983. The exceptions are the Election Petition Rules and
    the ADR Rules which were made as separate Rules and therefore appear
    in this volume after the end of the National Court Rules 1983 -
    2011.
