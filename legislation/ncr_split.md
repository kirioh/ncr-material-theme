### 49\. Motions (Amendment) Rules 2005.

Purpose.

contained in Civil Jurisdiction Bulletin 2004. These Rules include a
consolidation of those previous Practice Directions & Notes. Upon coming
into operation of these Rules, those Practice Directions & Notes shall
cease to apply. The purpose of these Rules is to improve the disposition
of motions and other interlocutory applications in all civil cases, in a
quick, fair and cheap manner.

### 1\. Motions List.

compile a Motions List containing Motions filed for all civil cases
except Motions in the following matters ---

a\. Appeals,

b\. Judicial Review,

c\. Commercial,

d\. Election Petitions,

e\. and in those cases which involve listing issues such as Motions
seeking leave to dispense with requirements for notice to set down for
trial or applications for dismissal of proceedings for want of
prosecution or under Order 12 Rule 40 and Order 8 Rule 27 of the
*National Court Rules*.

manage the motions list and to perform other duties required of him or
her under the Rules or as required by the Registrar.

application, and why the matter is urgent.

\(b\) The Registrar will then fix a time for the hearing in
consultation with the Motions Judge.

\(c\) If the judge grants the interim orders sought, they must be made
returnable before the Court on a fixed date. The judge must also make
orders for filing and service of the Court Order, Originating process,
Notice of Motion and supporting affidavit, Undertaking as to damages,
security for costs and any other relevant documents, on the defendant
or any other person directly affected by the order.

***ii. Urgent ex parte applications in other cases.***

application, must contact the Registrar in writing, explaining the
reasons for the urgency and why the requirements for service of the
Motion is sought to be dispensed with.

will fix a time and date for the hearing of the Motion, in
consultation with the Motions Judge.

\(c\) The application will not be set down for hearing unless the

the defendant in order for service to be effected.

including:

i\. An order dispensing with requirements of service;

ii\. An interim order which provides some solution, until the return
date;

that other person need not be made a defendant to the proceedings.

\(3\) Where, under Sub-rule (2), the Court appoints a person who is not
a defendant, the Court shall make an order under Rule 8 adding him as a
defendant.

not be enforced against any person not a party to the proceedings except
with the leave of the Court.

\(5\) An application for leave under Sub-rule (4) shall be made by
motion, notice of which shall be served personally on the person against
whom it is sought to enforce the judgement or order.

\(6\) Notwithstanding that a judgement or order to which an application

application is made, that person may dispute liability to have the
judgement or order enforced against him on the ground that by reason of
facts and matters particular to his case he is entitled to be exempted
from the liability.

\(7\) This Rule does not apply to proceedings concerning ---

\(a\) the administration of the estate of a deceased person; or

may be interested (whether presently or for any future, contingent or
unascertained interest) in, or affected by, the proceedings.

\(2\) The conditions for the exercise of the power conferred by Sub-rule
(1) are ---

\(a\) that the person, the class of persons or some member of the
class, cannot be ascertained or cannot readily be ascertained; and

\(b\) that the person, class of persons or some member of the class,
though ascertained, cannot be found; and

\(c\) that, though the person or the class of persons and the members
of the class can be ascertained and found, it appears to the Court
expedient (regard being had to all the circumstances, including the
amount at stake and the degree of difficulty of the point to be
determined) to exercise the power for the purpose of saving expense.

\(3\) Where in any proceedings the Court exercises the power conferred
by Sub-rule (1), a judgement or order entered or made in the proceedings
shall be binding on the person or class of persons represented as if he
or they were parties.

\(4\) Where, in any such proceedings as are referred to in Sub-rule (1),
a compromise is proposed and some of the persons who are interested in,
or who may be affected by, the compromise are not parties to the
proceedings (including unborn or unascertained persons) but ---

\(a\) there is a party in the same interest who assents to the
compromise or on whose behalf the Court sanctions the compromise; or

\(b\) the absent persons are represented by a person appointed under
Sub-rule (1) and he so assents,

the Court, if satisfied that the compromise will be for the benefit of
the absent persons, may approve the compromise and order that it shall
be binding on the absent persons, and they shall be bound accordingly
except where the order has been obtained by fraud or non-disclosure of
material facts.

\(1\) Where any proceedings, including proceedings to enforce a security
by way of foreclosure or otherwise, are brought by or against a trustee,
executor or administrator ---

\(a\) it shall not be necessary to join as a party any of the persons
having a beneficial interest under the trust or in the estate; and

\(b\) a judgement or order in the proceedings shall, subject to
Sub-rule (2), be as binding on those persons as it is on the trustee,
executor or administrator.

\(2\) Where a judgement is entered or an order is made in proceedings to
which Sub-rule (1) applies and it appears to the Court that in those
proceedings the trustee, executor or administrator could not or did not
in fact represent the interests of the persons having a beneficial
interest under the trust or in the estate, the Court may, in those or
other proceedings, order, on terms, that the judgement so entered or the
order so made shall not be binding on those persons.

\(3\) Sub-rule (1) does not limit the power of the Court to order the
addition of parties under Rule 8.

### 16\. Deceased person. (8/16)

\(1\) Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that a deceased
person was interested, or that the estate of a deceased person is
interested, in any matter in question in the proceedings and that he has
no personal representative, the Court may, on the application of any
party ---

\(a\) order that the proceedings continue in the absence of a person
representing the estate of the deceased person; or

\(b\) by order (with the consent of the person appointed) appoint a
person to represent that estate for the purposes of the proceedings.

\(2\) An order under Sub-rule (1), and any judgement or order
subsequently entered or made in the proceedings, shall bind the estate
of the deceased person to the same extent as the estate would have been
bound had a personal representative of the deceased person been a party
to the proceedings.

\(3\) Before making an order under this Rule, the Court may require
notice of the application for the order to be given to such (if any) of
the persons having an interest in the estate as it thinks fit.

Court is satisfied that the mistake was not misleading nor such as to

to correct the mistake, whether or not the effect of the amendment is to
substitute a new party.

Purpose.

The purpose of these Rules is to prescribe procedures for the conduct of

Appeals List. The Appeals List is conducted by a judge(s) assigned by
the Chief Justice.

These Rules includes a consolidation of previous Practice Directions and
Notes issued by the Registrar in relation to appeals, which are
contained in Practice Direction Book 2004. Upon commencement of these
Rules, those practice directions and notes will cease to apply. These
Rules are intended to improve the disposition of appeal cases in the
National Court, in a quick, fair and cheap manner.

The National Court's appellate jurisdiction is conferred by various
statutes, the main one being the *District Court Act* (Ch No. 240). The
procedure for appeals in relation to appeals from the District Court is
prescribed by this Act. Other statutes which provide for appeals from
other statutory tribunals either prescribe their own procedure or adopt
the procedure under the *District Court Act*, e.g. s.49 of the *Workers
Compensation Act* (Ch No. 172). Other statutes are silent, e.g. s. 58 of
the Lawyers Act 1986, in which case the procedure under the *District
Courts Act* is usually adopted. These Rules are to be read subject to
those provisions.

appeals cases pending determination in the National Court. This list
shall be updated at the end of every circuit month.

to appeal, dispensation of condition precedent to the right of appeal,
etc; commenced by Origination Summons.

### 3\. Judge.

The Chief Justice may assign a judge(s) to conduct the Appeals List as
may be determined in the *Annual Circuit Calendar* issued by the Chief
Justice.

### 4\. Senior Clerk.

The Registrar shall assign a Senior Clerk and such other Clerks to
manage the Appeal List and to perform duties of the Registrar given
under these Rules.

### 5\. Directions Hearing.

\(1\) Upon receipt of the Notice of Appeal by the Registrar, the
Registrar shall fix a date for Directions Hearing before the Judge to
take place within 14 days.

A, and it shall be given to the Appellant at the time the Notice of
Appeal is filed, and cause a copy to be forwarded to the Respondent.

\(3\) The Directions Hearing shall be conducted by the Judge, every
Mondays except on the Monday of the Supreme Court week.

\(4\) Where parties are represented by a lawyer, a lawyer who has
knowledge of the case must attend the Directions Hearing.

\(5\) At the Directions Hearing, the judge may consider and determine
and give such directions as may be necessary for the prompt disposition
of the appeal, amongst other things, the following: ---

*(a) Question of legal representation.*

*(b) Failure to comply with any condition precedent to the right of
appeal prescribed by statute.*

*(c) Dispensation or waiver of any condition precedent to the right of
appeal prescribed by Statute.*

the Court depositions are provided by the Clerk of Court or appropriate
officer of the tribunal or authority which made the decision and
received by the National Court.

Where a handwritten transcript is provided by a Magistrate, then the
lawyer must ensure that they are typed by the lawyer and sent back to
the Clerk with the hand-written original from whom the transcript has
been received to certify in the following words:

*\"I,\..., Clerk of the Court hereby certify that I have examined the
attached transcript with the original and certify that it is correct.*

*Dated the . . . day of . . . 20 . . .*

*. . . (Clerk)*

This Certificate entitled with the name and number of the National

personam, a defendant fails to lodge a preliminary act within the
prescribed period, Order 12 Rule 26 shall apply as if the defendant\'s

the period fixed by or under these Rules for service and the plaintiff,
if he has lodged a preliminary act may accordingly enter judgement
against that defendant in accordance with Order 12 Rule 26.

counterclaim by the plaintiff, then, notwithstanding Order 8 Rule 21,

writ, a copy of the statement of claim, the plaintiff may apply to the
Court for judgement by default.

(3A) Where the writ is deemed to have been duly served on the defendant
by virtue of Order 6 Rule 8 or was served on a registrar under Rule 8 of
this Order, an affidavit proving due service of the writ need not be

endorsed by the Registrar with a statement that he accepts service of
the writ must be lodged with the affidavit verifying the facts on which
the action is based.

\(4\) Where a defendant to an action in rem fails to serve a defence on
the plaintiff, then, after the expiration of the period fixed by or
under these Rules for service of the defence and on filing an affidavit
stating that no defence was served on him by that defendant during that

that period, an affidavit verifying the facts on which the counterclaim
is based and a copy of the counterclaim, the defendant making the

order the property against which the action or, as the case may be,
counterclaim is brought to be appraised and sold and the proceeds to be
paid into Court or may make such other order as it thinks just.

\(8\) In default actions in rem evidence may, unless the Court otherwise

    NATIONAL COURT RULES

    A consolidation of the Rules of the National Court\
    made between 1983 and 2011 current at 1st December 2012

[^2]: **RULES OF COURT**

    **NATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE**

    **Consolidation 1983-2011**

    Prior to the Independence of Papua New Guinea on 16 September 1975
    the superior trial court of Papua New Guinea was the Supreme Court,
    which sat with three or more judges as the appellate court. The
    Rules of the Supreme Court were substantially based on the Supreme
    Court Rules of Queensland, Australia.

    At Independence the Constitution established the National Court
    (Section 163(1)) as the superior trial court and the Supreme Court
    (Section 160(1)) as the appellate court. There are now different
    sets of rules with respect to the practice and procedure of each
    court. The National Court continued to function under the
    pre-Independence Rules of the Supreme Court until the National Court
    Rules were made by the Judges in 1983, pursuant to Section 184 of
    the Constitution. Many of the 1983 rules were sourced from the
    Supreme Court of New South Wales, some from the United Kingdom and
    others from the Australian Capital Territory and the Victorian Rules
    of Court. At the inception of the National Court Rules 1983 and for
    many years after reference works on the United Kingdom and New South
    Wales rules were found helpful. However now there are many Papua New
    Guinea cases to cite in aid of interpretation, especially in the
    more common areas of practice.

    This consolidation of the rules of court for the National Court has
    been occasioned by the fact that the original 1983 rules are out of
    print and, there has never been a consolidation of the 1983 rules,
    with amendments and new rules made since then. No amendments are
    introduced by this volume, which is strictly a consolidation of
    existing Rules. It brings together:

    ·National Court Rules 1983
    
    · National Court Appeal Rules 2005
    
    · National Court Motions Rules 2005
    
    · National Court Judicial Review Rules 2005
    
    · National Court Commercial List Rules 2005
    
    · National Court Election Petition Rules 2002 (as amended 2007)
    
    · ADR \[Alternative Dispute Resolution\] Rules 2010
    
    · Human Rights Rules 2010
    
    · Rules of the National Court of Justice (Underlying Law
    Amendment) 2011

    Most rules made since 1983 have been amendments to the National
    Court Rules 1983. The exceptions are the Election Petition Rules and
    the ADR Rules which were made as separate Rules and therefore appear
    in this volume after the end of the National Court Rules 1983 -
    2011.
