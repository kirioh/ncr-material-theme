# ORDER 18.-APPEAL RULES.

## Division 1 A.-Appeals from the District Court and other statutory tribunals.

**Purpose.**

The purpose of these Rules is to prescribe procedures for the conduct of
appeal cases in the National Court with the establishment of a separate
Appeals List. The Appeals List is conducted by a judge(s) assigned by
the Chief Justice.

These Rules includes a consolidation of previous Practice Directions and
Notes issued by the Registrar in relation to appeals, which are
contained in Practice Direction Book 2004. Upon commencement of these
Rules, those practice directions and notes will cease to apply. These
Rules are intended to improve the disposition of appeal cases in the
National Court, in a quick, fair and cheap manner.

The National Court's appellate jurisdiction is conferred by various
statutes, the main one being the *[District Courts Act](http://www.paclii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/pg/legis/consol_act/dca1963205/dca1963205.html)* (Ch No. 240). The
procedure for appeals in relation to appeals from the District Court is
prescribed by this Act. Other statutes which provide for appeals from
other statutory tribunals either prescribe their own procedure or adopt
the procedure under the *[District Courts Act](http://www.paclii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/pg/legis/consol_act/dca1963205/dca1963205.html)*, e.g. s.49 of the 
*[Workers Compensation Act](http://www.paclii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/pg/legis/consol_act/wca1978255/wca1978255.html)* (Ch No. 172). Other statutes are silent, e.g. s. 58 of
the *Lawyers Act* 1986, in which case the procedure under the *[District Courts Act](http://www.paclii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/pg/legis/consol_act/dca1963205/dca1963205.html)* is usually adopted. These Rules are to be read subject to
those provisions.
